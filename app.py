    st.markdown("""
    To maximize model robustness and simulate real-world variability, a range of safe, label-preserving augmentations were applied using the Albumentations library. Each putative augmentation was selected both for its visual realism and its safety (i.e., it does NOT distort object geometry, so bounding boxes remain correct):

    **RandomBrightnessContrast**  
    Adjusts the brightness and contrast of the image.  
    *Why:* Simulates varying lighting conditions found in industrial settings, ensuring the detector remains accurate whether environments are dark or brightly lit.

    **HueSaturationValue**  
    Alters the hue, saturation, and value (color intensity) of images.  
    *Why:* Emulates changes from different camera types or ambient lighting, preventing overfit to any fixed color tone.

    **GaussNoise**  
    Adds random Gaussian noise across the image.  
    *Why:* Prepares the model for lower-quality or noisy cameras, typical in industrial and warehouse monitoring.

    **ImageCompression**  
    Simulates JPEG compression artifacts.  
    *Why:* Builds resilience to images stored/transmitted at lower quality, which is common in real-time monitoring systems.

    **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)**  
    Enhances local contrast in images.  
    *Why:* Improves detection of objects against backgrounds with poor or uneven contrast.

    **RGBShift**  
    Randomly shifts the R, G, and B color channels.  
    *Why:* Helps the model generalize to images with varying white balance (color tint).

    **Blur**  
    Applies mild blur to the entire image.  
    *Why:* Ensures the model still detects objects in images that are slightly out of focus.

    **Sharpen**  
    Increases edge and detail sharpness.  
    *Why:* Encourages the model to rely on shape cues as well as color.

    **MotionBlur**  
    Applies blur in a particular direction.  
    *Why:* Simulates the effect of cameras or objects moving during image capture.

    For each source image, two augmented variants were created, effectively tripling dataset size (original + 2 augmentations per example). Each augmentation was applied with a certain probability, ensuring diverse but realistic alterations.

    **Label Integrity:**  
    The augmentation pipeline only transforms the pixel data; bounding box annotation files are copied directly, so all object location data remains accurate for YOLO training.

    **Outcome:**  
    By systematically applying and explaining these augmentations, the resulting training set covers a wide spectrum of real-world imaging scenarios—making your detection model more accurate, versatile, and resilient in practical deployment.

    st.markdown("""
    1. **Model Selection and Initialization**

    Chose the high-capacity YOLOv8l (large variant) architecture for its excellent balance of detection precision and speed on modern GPUs.

    Leveraged transfer learning by initializing with pretrained weights (yolov8l.pt), allowing for faster convergence and better performance even with moderate dataset sizes.

    2. **Training Strategy**

    Custom Dataset Configuration: Used a YAML file specifying dataset paths and class names to ensure the model is fine-tuned specifically to the project’s detection targets.

    Epochs: Trained for 50 epochs—optimized to mitigate overfitting observed in earlier, longer runs.

    Image Resolution: Set imgsz=640 for high input resolution, capturing small or detailed features of safety equipment objects.

    Batch Size: Conservatively set to 4 to suit the available T4 GPU memory while maintaining stable training.

    Optimizer: Switched to AdamW for robust, generalized updates on complex object detection problems.

    Learning Rate and Regularization: Used a low learning rate (1e-4) and weight decay (0.001) for stable learning and to avoid overfitting.

    Early Stopping: Implemented with increased patience (20)—training stops automatically when validation loss stagnates, ensuring the model is never overtrained.

    Dropout & Label Smoothing:

    Dropout (0.10) introduces randomness for better generalization, especially useful on small datasets.

    Label smoothing (0.05) reduces overconfidence on potentially noisy or ambiguous labels.

    3. **Augmentation and Generalization Controls**

    Extensive, controlled augmentations during training to increase robustness:

    Mosaic (0.4): Combines multiple images, helping learn context and scale variety.

    Mixup (0.15): Light blending of image/label pairs for regularization.

    HSV Adjustments: Subtle changes to hue (0.015), saturation (0.6), and brightness (0.4), making the model invariant to color and lighting shifts.

    Translate (0.1) & Scale (0.5): Mild spatial transforms for small location and size inconsistencies.

    All augmentations are probabilistic and carefully tuned to provide diversity without creating unrealistic instances.

    4. **Training Infrastructure**

    Training performed on GPU (cuda:0) for speed and efficiency.

    Project structure (project="hackbyte-final", name="yolov8l-augmented") and validation enabled for rigorous experiment management.

    All preprocessed (original + augmented) images were merged into the training set, maximizing model exposure to visual diversity.

    st.subheader("What is Intersection over Union (IoU)?")

    st.markdown(r"""
    Intersection over Union (IoU) is a fundamental metric used in object detection to evaluate the accuracy of predicted bounding boxes. It measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box by calculating the ratio of the area of their intersection to the area of their union:

    \[
    \text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Area of Overlap}}{\text{Area of Union}}
    \]

    An IoU of 1 means the predicted box perfectly matches the ground truth.

    An IoU of 0 means there is no overlap.

    A prediction is considered correct if its IoU exceeds a threshold (commonly 0.5), which is why metrics like mAP50 use this threshold to determine true positive detections.

    st.header("Challenges")

    st.markdown("""
    Initially, extensive image-only augmentations were applied during dataset preparation to increase data diversity and improve model robustness. These included brightness, contrast, noise, blur, and color adjustments that preserved label accuracy.

    During training, to specifically address overfitting detected after several epochs, we introduced a second layer of carefully tuned augmentations. These included reducing mosaic augmentation intensity to 0.4, applying mild mixup at 0.15, and subtle adjustments to hue, saturation, brightness, translation, and scale. This training-stage augmentation helped the model generalize better to new data by exposing it to realistic variations in object appearance and positioning.

    Additionally, early stopping with a patience parameter was used to monitor validation performance and halt training when improvements plateaued. This combined approach of pre-training augmentations and targeted training augmentations, alongside early stopping, was key to developing a stable, high-performing, and generalizable model.

    st.header("Final Summary")

    st.markdown("""
    This project successfully developed a highly accurate YOLOv8l-based object detection system tailored for critical safety equipment identification in industrial settings. The model achieved an outstanding mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 96.5%, which is a decisive indicator of its superior accuracy in detecting and localizing objects with minimal false positives and false negatives.

    This level of precision and robustness is a standout achievement, demonstrating the model’s readiness for deployment in real-world environments where reliable detection of safety assets like fire extinguishers, tool boxes, and oxygen tanks is crucial for operational safety and compliance.

    By combining extensive dataset augmentations, carefully tuned training augmentations, and early stopping to counter overfitting, the system not only backed high accuracy but also ensured strong generalization to new, unseen data. The rapid inference speed on standard GPU hardware further underscores its suitability for real-time industrial safety monitoring applications.

    Overall, the model’s near-perfect precision and the exceptionally high mAP50 performance make it a winning solution with significant potential impact on automating industrial safety audits, reducing risks, and enhancing workplace safety effectively.
