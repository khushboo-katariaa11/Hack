3. **Mount Google Drive**: Run the first cell to mount your drive
4. **Add dataset**: Upload `Hackathon_Dataset.zip` to your Google Drive root
5. **Run all cells**: The notebook will automatically handle extraction, training, and evaluation

The notebook includes all necessary code for:
- Automatic dataset extraction and preparation
- YAML configuration file generation  
- Model training with optimized hyperparameters
- Performance evaluation and visualization
- Model download for deployment

#### Manual Setup (Step-by-Step Guide)

For those who want to understand each step, here's the complete training process:

#### Step 1: Setup Google Colab Environment

1. **Open Google Colab** and create a new notebook
2. **Mount Google Drive** to access your dataset:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

3. **Upload the dataset** to your Google Drive:
   - Download the HackByte Dataset from the provided link
   - Upload `Hackathon_Dataset.zip` to your Google Drive root (`/content/drive/MyDrive/`)

#### Step 2: Extract and Prepare Dataset

```python
import zipfile

    batch=8,                      # Optimized for T4 GPU memory (15GB)
    optimizer="AdamW",            # Superior to SGD for this dataset size
    lr0=1e-4,                     # Conservative learning rate for stability
    weight_decay=0.001,           # L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
    patience=15,                  # Early stopping after 15 epochs without improvement
    dropout=0.10,                 # Dropout regularization for generalization

    # Advanced data augmentation pipeline
    mosaic=0.4,                   # 40% mosaic augmentation (4 images combined)
    mixup=0.15,                   # 15% mixup augmentation (image blending)
    hsv_h=0.015,                  # Slight hue variation (±1.5%)
    hsv_s=0.6,                    # Saturation changes (±60%)
